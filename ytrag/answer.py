"""Retrieve -> grounded answer + citations.

The important part of this module is what it does when retrieval comes back
empty: it returns the refusal without calling the LLM at all.

The model knows DSA perfectly well. If it is handed junk context it will
happily answer from its own training and attach your timestamps to it — the
student clicks the link and you are talking about something else entirely.
That is strictly worse than saying "cover nahi hua".
